# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
---
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
---
The possibility of filtering by multiple criterias allows the user to get more information on specific UFO sightings if desired.

In this new version of the website, we can now filter for City, State, Country and shape. Narrowing down the search and having more conclusive results if the intention is to classify the UFOs.

## Summary
---
The problem that this brings is, whether you are an avid UFO researcher or not, it could, ironically alienate audiences that are just curious to see what they can find and maybe making it more complicated than neccesary and discarding without any intention multiple sightings that you were looking for.

Let's for example imagine you think one of those UFO was in Roswell when it was in fact in Benton.
